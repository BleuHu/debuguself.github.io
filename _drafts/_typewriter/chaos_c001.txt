Charpter 00X01 Why need typewriter?
 now, XXwe can writer anytime, anywhere, pcnelic with paper, finger with screen asmobiled anythings,
but, in the same time, we can not real writX e in long time,
just only 5min, us hand auto need XflXush SNS something, in china of ourse :wechat/weibo/..etc.
even we know there is unlimited infomation flow in there SNS app.
and that all fresh funny or sad news/message/images/photos/... is not aout mXeand we can do nothing for them.
but we had to, we can not crontal uself to flush every sreens,
even in fact, we are in pure XXXXalone in internet.
so what happend?
when we flush SNS app. even when we writXing?
i thinkX just for the "i can" with "why not",
because humenbin's Xbrain be desing for want hold more and more infomations,
to help us to judgment the dendurngs among usX:
run or stand
 even now, we livinXvery safe city, with very kindly nibhoud,
sot us brain also need more and more infomation for unknow dengourse.
 so for real writing, we need some tools, or evn. for make us escapted form inter et, just face only self and words, 
luckly, typewriter is the bester tooXls,
it only functionXis type, and XXXXXX log word in paper with XXXX click sounds,
so XXwrite with one typewriter, we only can do things, is type, type down wordfor us wrods,
ther is not net XXXXXXXX XXX connected, not screen can flush,
Xus XXXXXX finger only can XXdo just type, type for ever with click click....
of course, every type out, just immeditly print in paper, and very like publishXdin book, so any tyXXpy Xout words, in fact is already Xlike us workXs, that isone kinds of effectivity, and like one push inside, we like cliXXck and printpaper, so writXing is funny now, beoynd flush sreen, we are write now, not makewriteX, just wait SNS alert:
"XHiiii update, new news, new things, new XXXXXphotos, new..."
